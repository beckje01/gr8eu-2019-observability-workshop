== Lab 02 -- Tracing

Same apps just add tracing.

== Tracing Terminology


=== What is Distributed Tracing

Distributed tracing systems collect end-to-end latency graphs
(traces) in near real-time.

* https://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html[Dapper]

=== Terminology Lesson

* **Span** - An operation that took place.
* **Event** - Something that occurs in a span.
* **Tag** - Key value pair on a span.

=== Terminology Lesson

* **Trace** - End-to-end latency graph, made up of spans.
* **Tracer** - Library that records spans and passes context
* **Instrumentation** - Use of a tracer to record tasks.
* **Sample %** - How often to record a trace.
